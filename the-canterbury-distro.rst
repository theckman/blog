|The Canterbury Distro|

The Canterbury Distribution, a group effort of the major
community-driven distributions, was "announced" early this morning on
the first of April, 2011. The distribution is a coordinated effort of
the following distributions:
Â 
-  Debian (http://www.debian.org)
-  Arch Linux (http://www.archlinux.org)
-  OpenSUSE (http://www.opensuse.org)
-  Gentoo (http://www.gentoo.org)
-  GRML (`http://www.grml.org`_)

The ultimate goal of the distribution is unify all of the distributions
in a stance against proprietary operating systems. To show that people
with such different views can come together to amidst diversity.

While most of you have recognized it as a cheeky April Fools joke it
does raise an interesting point about the "Linux Community". It's
actually not much of a community at all. It appears to be sharply
divided and opinionated.

While a Linux Community driven distribution would indeed be interesting,
it's nothing but a pipe dream. I think I'd be more interested in what
features of the various distributions are kept, and the discussions
relating to those decisions, rather than actually using the end product
itself. Nothing is perfect.

I wonder if all of packages would be unsigned. Speaking of Arch, there
appears to be a slight variation between all the other versions of that
site and the Arch Linux one. Have you spotted it?
