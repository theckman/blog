So back in 2010 when I started at Linode_ I decided I would undertake a
new endeavor in getting my shiny new system configured. I'd set up a
Wordpress blog. But that wasn't the new part. It was that I'd go a bit
outside of my comfort zone, and give Nginx with PHP-FastCGI a go.

I somehow convinced myself that I would have enough interesting things
to write about that it was worth while to set the blog up, and make sure
that I could make it perform as well as I wanted.

The FastCGI thing went fairly smoothly, I remember scratching my head a
bit. And eventually I moved on to php-fpm. Unfortunately, I never really
had anything interesting to write about. There were a few posts here and
there where I just wrote to vent, or set up some sweet IPv6 configuration
at home.

Wordpress, undoubtably, has become quite a large target when it comes to
compromising systems on the internet. Everyone and their mother's cat
blog uses it, so why not focus in on it. So I decided a bit ago that I
should exert the effort to move to a statically generated site for system
security reasons. There is also my opinion that Wordpress is a piece of
shit...which I will, henceforth, treat as fact.

So here I am again about to start a new chapter in my life, and have
decided to revamp the blog and hope that I have interesting things to
write about in the future. Sound familar?

The big change now is that I am moving to a place that I think will be a
ton more interesting, and hopefully give me some sort of inspiration. The
city of San Francisco has what I feel to be an awesome culture, and some
great views of the surrounding area.

I'm not really sure who I'll be writing for. I'm not sure I'll be writing
for anyone in particular...

Let's try to have some fun.
