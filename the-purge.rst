I recently accepted a position with PagerDuty in San Francisco. While it
took a bit of convincing, I managed to convince my girlfriend (now
fianc√©e) to make the trek with me to the other coast. One of the biggest
decisions we needed to make was what to keep and what to sell.

While this sounds trivial on first pass, it was definitely a lot more
difficult than I first imagined.

Deciding what not to keep
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before I said yes to the job I did some research on moving cross-
country. Going in to the research I had some ideas that moving my
belongings would be expensive; the real cost was definitely higher than
I had anticipated. For a POD which would completely accommodate us,
$4500. The U-HAUL alternative, which would ship less, $2300.

As a result of my research, I realized moving some of our belongings
was absolutely a possibility. But what should we move?

There is some criteria you should look at before even trying to narrow
the items down. The first is the area you are venturing to, and what
amenities you will have there. In my case, I first eliminated things that
were no longer a use to me. The biggest being my car. I'd rely on public
transportation.

Secondly, I decided what was, frankly, a piece of shit. There were
definitely a few different levels of "shit". You should pick and choose
which level each item falls under:

* Not worth me moving, but might be worth something to someone else
* Not worth anyone's time, time to put it out of its misery

Lastly, what is something that might not work for us in Cali? Without
having an apartment picked out, it was hard to determine what will
fit in to our eventual place. Even if it would fit, is it worth losing
that much space in the shipping container for it?

Meredith had a *beautiful* West Elm sectional with a chaise. Brand new,
this sectional retailed for well over $1600. However, we weren't sure
how large our apartment was going to be...we decided to sell it.

From there, it was easy to make a list of things we could get rid of. We
made sure not to commit to getting rid of most of them first.

Deciding what to keep
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It turns out, knocking things you want off the list first made this task
much more productive. Especially as after some thought we were able to
decide to keep some items that we were originally going to get rid of.

The first piece of criteria was a lot more emotional than financial.
These were the items that are sentimental to us, and that we couldn't see
ourselves leaving behind. For me, this was my dad's old desk. I don't use
it much, but it means a lot to me. Meredith had this antique dresser that
definitely has some character.

The second piece of information was which items were worth it to keep.
I'll admit this was tricky as "worth" is a bit of a loaded term, and
doesn't have a specific definition. We needed to strike some sort of balance
to make the shipping worth-while for the items we already wanted to keep,
but also not ship too much so that we had too much. There were some items
that we could replace when moving to California, but it would not be
convenient. Such as my old dresser, a dresser Meredith has, and things
like linens and dinnerware. For these items, we decided it was just
sensible to ship them.

The End
^^^^^^^
In the end, we managed to break just about even when it came to the cost
of shipping items and replacing them. In other words, the items we are
shipping would cost about the same to replace. There is an added
convenience factor in that we don't need to actually spend the time
trying to decide what to replace the items with.

Most of the items we decided to keep are a bit smaller than the things
we decided to get rid of.

Keeping
-------
Here's a short list of things we are taking with us:

* Linens
* Our dressers, my dad's desk and late grandfather's comfy recliner
* The kitchen table and chairs, as well as the TV stand
* Our electronics (my tower, her printer, routers, DJ equipment, etc.)
* Dinnerware (glasses, plates, bowls) and other cooking items (pots, pans, etc.)
* Meredith's cat...

Not Keeping
-----------
* My car :(
* Sectional, coffee table, and Mere's Antoinette Fainting Sofa
* Both of our desks
* Our bed
* Miscellaneous lamps

All-In-All
----------

In theory what we decided is win-win. For some things we get to purchase
brand new, for others we are keeping. We'll see how this works out in
execution!
